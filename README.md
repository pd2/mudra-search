I developed a word search in a letter grid game as a web app. The challenge is to search for object names  (in English) that the Bharatanatyam mudras represent - both Samyuktha (two handed) and Asamyuktha (one-handed) mudras - in a grid of English alphabets. 

One can test their search skills as a words can be in horizontal, vertical, diagonal even in reverse order. When the player correctly identifies the mudras, they will see the time taken by them. One can learn more about Bharatanatyam and the different mudras. This is supported both on desktop and handheld devices. This is best played on a desktop.

I solved #Mudra search in a letter grid game to learn about Mayura Bharatanatyam mudra in 15 sec
